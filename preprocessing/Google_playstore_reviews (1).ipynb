Free app, I get it, but the ad amount is practically outweighing the actual content. There's also a lot of features/app settings only able to be changed/turned off with the premium (paid) version now, including the permanent top-of-messaging AI confirming this to be true. I still like it for talking to friends/keeping streaks, but that's the only reason I haven't uninstalled it.🥲🫠\", 'Good app for communicating with friends, but dragged down by braindead \"features.\" No, I don\\'t want to see random people\\'s public profiles, if I did, I would look for it. No, I don\\'t want to see quick add all the time, evidenced by the fact that I turn contact synching off every day, and don\\'t allow myself to show up in quick-add. Not to mention the decreased camera quality or weird camera glitches that I\\'ve been experiencing lately where it stretches the image in weird ways. This app is a mess.', 'I have been using snapchat for years. And now, on occasion, when I open the app, the screen shows me as if I have my phone turned horizontal when I am holding it vertically. And as of recently, the screen distorts and stretches my face. Both of these only go away when I take a photo. When I take the photo, it appears normally, but if I go back to try to take another picture, it changes my face again. And, the issue does not go away when I close out and reopen the app.', 'There are always new little bugs that are super annoying. As soon as one seems to be fixed, theres a new issue somewhere else. Most recently, the button to post to \"My Story\" doesn\\'t work. I\\'ve found other ways to post what I want but why have a quick button if it isn\\'t going to work. Also, not sure when it happened but at some point everything that I post stopped automatically saving to Memories, I just want to know why? I\\'ve been using Snapchat less and less.', 'Too many changes in this new update. The ai thing is creepy and i don\\'t like it and can\\'t find a way to delete it. The constant \"quick add\" popping up is so annoying. The layout is also a bit different. I wouldn\\'t have even updated the app if it hadn\\'t been glitching a lot earlier. Now i seriously regret updating because it\\'s so horrible. Snapchat WAS a simple, convenient way to talk to my friends but now it\\'s all crazy and weird.', \"It's okay but for the life of me, I cannot figure out why my app isn't sending notifications anymore. All notifications and settings are set to send them but I am missing messages because it's not sending notifications that someone had sent me anything. My video call feed keeps freezing like 2 seconds after I turn on my camera too...Needs to be fixed but other than that, it's a good app.\", \"I've had audio issues with the app for nearly a year now. My memories often times no longer have audio, and videos that are sent to me (saved videos by others) hardly ever have audio. I used to really like this app but it's gotten significantly worse over time. Assistance is also virtually non-existent. There are several threads on Reddit of similar bugs going back 3 years that have never been fixed\", \"Hi there, when I first got this app, Snapchat has been great! Easy to use and so on, but lately, I've been experiencing some glitches and buggy things happening, I have tried to restart my phone, reopening the app, and other ways! It won't let me send, see, or connect with my friends, my wifi and internet connection have been perfectly fine, I tried other apps as well and I found no issues, but when going to Snapchat, there is an issue with communicating, please help me/others fix this problem!\", \"I recently got a new phone, the Pixel 8 Pro. And Snapchat runs smoothly. But whenever I use the phones back camera's, it seems like it doesn't know how to properly switch between the different lenses when zooming in and out. It ends up making it very jittery and hard to anticipate. I've loved using this app since I started using it. I just want to see it get better. And Little bugs like that decrease the quality of the app overall. Hopefully this is fixed soon.\", \"Constant unnecessary notifications that can't be turned off without turning off all notifications, mostly pertaining to when someone posts. Plus, they've taken features and made them exclusive for Premium, which I (and most others) have zero interest in. Aside from that, it works well most of the time. Snap isn't social media; it's instant messaging.\", \"What Happened to Sending Videos?! For about a year now, I've been unable to send full videos even if they're under a minute long. No alert or anything, it just sends 10 seconds of the video and then cuts off. I remember when sending long videos through snapchat wasn't an issue and now I can't even send 25 second ones. The AI assistant is sketchy and not ever helpful. Keep the app simple. It's bogged down with spotlight and random stories of people I don't know.\", 'Not worth downloading or even keeping anymore. This is the bottom of the barrel as far as social media apps. All the content is just ads. It\\'s 10s of content and 30s of ads. Now the \"View Profile\" tab blocks a ton of the screen so you can\\'t even see what\\'s supposed to be there anymore. 90% of the content falsely advertises with the thumbnail. My review keeps getting worse because the app is worse and worse. This is the LAST thing you should download. Should have 0 stars.', \"It's not a problem with my phone. I have already gone to the Verizon store and they can't figure it out. For some reason Snapchat notifications make my phone go off without a sound. Without a auditory notification system I miss out on a lot of snaps. Why is it so hard to create an app that actually notifies auditorally when you have a message. Turns out it's actually an issue with auto updates not automatically updating through the Play store even though it's ticked to automatically update.\", \"Snapchat was a great app. But after so many updates it only seems to get worse. Is the AI feature and getting notifications when someone is typing really that necessary? It crashes every single time. Posting stories and texting has has became really frustrating. When I'm viewing a story it crashes and glitches by itself. Sometimes I don't even get notifications at all. And the 3d bitmojis look absolutely horrible. Video calling with friends has become really glitchy and the audio doesn't work.\", \"I've been having a problem with this app for at least 4 months now. It's like the whole app is a glitch. Streaks disappearing and coming back, Filters not working, pictures are frozen on the screen until I close out the app, and it says I haven't snapped someone in 2 weeks but I snapped them 5 minutes ago. It's up to date. Very tempted to delete it.\", \"I've had Snapchat for years now and don't get me wrong, it's a good social app! But every time I use a filter, taking pictures or taking videos are super slow to work. I don't know what happened since it was working a few days ago; I tried reinstalling the app and even restarting my phone. I'm never bugged by the Ai but as an android user, I think dark mode should be free as well as pinning users. It's quite unfair. Thanks for reading!\", \"It sucks. It makes it super good for apple users (like dark mode) but for everyone else it kills the app. It keeps trying to push Snapchat plus, the fake tik tok and random stories of people you don't know. Sharing photos or videos from your library is a nightmare. The app is just full of garbage and poor choices. There's an ai that's stuck at the top of your conversation page and you have to PAY MONEY for a feature no one wanted. It also gives annoying notifications each time somepme types.\", \"It used to be a go-to app for me to text friends really quickly but now its just frustrating. The constant updates made it really glitchy on my phone. When I'm typing a caption on a photo, it disappears right as I tap away from the keyboard so I have to retype the whole caption or send an entirely different photo if I accidentally press send too quick. The AI feature is useless to me but there's no option to delete the bot from my chats. The bitmojis are also extremely unpleasant to look at now.\", \"It's an amazing app I would recommend this app for many people, so I recommend a 5 minute ad about this app for more people to download it. I only have one issue I can't view any story with out an ad popping up every 5 second I cant even continue watching with out restarting the whole vid over again. Update: it's still happening also can you please remove the screenshot so the other person doesn't get notified when you took one of the chat it's annoying tbh.\", 'It used to be one of my most used social media apps but for about a month, it\\'s been super buggy. The current issues are unbearable.. I can\\'t send snaps or chats. Every time I create a message (snap or chat) it simply disappears after I press \"send\". And it\\'s always a mystery to me whether my friends will get it or not because to me it looks like the messages never even existed. THE APP IS SIMPLY USELESS IN REGARDS TO COMMUNICATION.', 'This app is completely psychotic. It literally WILL NOT STOP sending you notifications. You can clear a notification only to have the same exact message will pop back up literally seconds after you got rid of it. The developers of this app are sick in the head and I pity them. Also, your suggestions are complete and utter garbage. Why do you even try? Just stop.', \"Love this app, it continues to improve often. The only thing that makes me absolutely crazy is if you are watching their extra clips, the 25 ads in between a 2 min video is kind of ridiculous.... I get ads, theyre necessary. But maybe *before and *after the clips would be wiser. It's not like we aren't going to watch them... It's prob the most irritating thing. Def would be 5 stars if they can get their ad quantity under control AND not interrupt clips every few seconds.\", \"Recently reinstalled this app since I wanted a cheap collage done to help me visualize flower arrangements for a project and the sticker maker would do just fine for my purposes. After I made the simple collage, I wanted to export it to my email so that I could zoom in on the image because sc was not allowing me to. This is where I got a circle of death for 5 minutes before my account was locked for no apparent reason. And nothing is fixing it. Should've used Instagram or Microsoft paint.\", \"Ever since y'all changed the snap time from 60 seconds to 120 seconds, the upload speed has been absolute garbage. Adding an option to choose whether you want to record 60 or 120 seconds at a time would be really nice, along with putting the little timer window back in the corner of the screen. Not sure why that got taken off but it was extremely useful and now it's gone\", \"This app used to be okay. I've began disliking it after frequently getting pop-ups for joining my school. I simply won't. More recently, in the stories section of the app, random people appear. I do not want to see random peoples' stories. There appears to be no way to disable it, which I find to be just stupid. Random people who I don't have added and don't have any idea who they are also appear after I take a snap and click send, once again, with no way to remove it. I'm probably going to quit\", 'This app has changed alot, its unfortunate how you cant dobmuch with the settings and its quite an invasive app. It shows your camera roll right on the screen without anyway to turn it off, and forces you to have access to your camera roll and your pervious photos you have taken even when you are not using your camera roll to send snaps. Be better.', \"I loved this app, but ever since the last update the filters don't work. Any filter that alters someone's face, I can take a picture but I can't take video anymore. The audio will come up normally and yet the video is like it's doing a slideshow, each frame holds for 5 seconds before switching to the next. Most of the app functions normally but filters that alter people's faces just will not work and it's driving me insane. They worked a couple weeks ago so what did you guys do????\", \"This app is super buggy. Every time I add continuous video it either sends the cut clips in the wrong order, or duplicates the clip twice. Along side this I find the discover feed thing to be annoying, as well as the quick add feature. I feel like they're always trying to shove random people down my throat whenever I use the app. I just want you communicate with my friends. I wish there was an option to turn it off. The amount of times I almost sent personal stuff to random people is crazy.\", \"For the last few months, it is giving me problems with viewing my pictures. Super laggy and slow. And it no longer gives me the option to delete or edit my photos. No option menu at all. My internet connection is just fine, so it's not that. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but the app is still not letting me edit or delete photos anymore. No option menu is coming up on photos and it's taking super long just to be able to view a photo.\", \"Horeible. Why can't you fix your app so that when a person makes a continuous video. When you click on there page to get the second video you can't find it.!!! Can you please make it easier for user to find the continuous video. This really upsets me. I watch a video and they say they have to continue it in another video and we'll you can't find it. It makes me mad!!. Gosh make it easier for your users!! I will change ratings once it's done!!\", \"The app functionality has been alright, not really here to comment on that. The bitmojis..I did not see the need to update them again, and they look worse. The extra detail really isn't needed when the previous ones actually looked good. Plus, the way the new one looks while editing and how it stands is definitely worse as well. If you're going to continue updating them, please keep the stickers how they are with the previous ones. Or give us an option to choose our bitmoji design, please.\", \"It does what it's supposed to, but I do have a few problems with the app. Like when you're on call with someone and when you open a different app, the call doesn't continue, and there's not pop up window anymore even when I have the setting turned on for that to happen. Also, it took too long for android users to get dark mode, which I don't find completely fair. Edit: I've removed a star because of the hideous bitmojis\", \"it's a easy way to send pictures and talk to other people but now it's just getting to be too much, an off-brand tiktok page, the bitmoji updates are starting to look a bit weird, I just wish we're the way they used to be. The AI is getting really annoying too, of there was a option to remove it completely that would be nice because sometimes when I click on a completely different conversation, it open the AI. The AI part of snap is all making me phone glitch a lot, but it could just be me.\", \"Please for the love of God fix the notification bug! It's been over a year and I STILL can't get notifications from people trying to message me. I may as well unfriend them so they don't think I'm ignoring them when it's been two weeks before I even notice it's there.. I have tried EVERYTHING from reinstalling, clearing the cache, turning off do not disturb, making sure notifications are on and at max volume. Nothing. It's utterly impossible to stay in touch with anyone on this platform.\", \". I can't take pictures with my flash on when I'm using the rear camera. It will glitch and just freeze until I press the back button on my phone and then it'll just completely kick me out of the app. That sucks. Can you please fix that...maybe. and then when I try to use my camera on video call it just keeps on loading and you can't see me. I can't take videos or pictures without it completely freezing up on me. Notifications are not always popping up.\", \"I like the app for messaging and sending videos/pictures back and forth to friends and I woulda given it 3 stars bc of some things that are wrong but I'm giving it 1 bc whenever certain ads pop up while watching stories it will automatically take me to chrome and wtv else. it is beyond annoying and aggravating when that happens and I hate going to my search history and just seeing a bunch of the same ad lining .y history, decent app that only seems to be getting worse.\", \"I can't see my best friends list/streaks when I try to send anything. I have to send snaps individually, I can't send spotlights to my best friends list either. I've uninstalled, reinstalled, logged out and back in, updated the app, and restarted the device and nothing has worked.\", \"Had my account since February of 22, and I've noticed some things, one, in order for it to run smoothly on a android, you kinda have to have snap +, even then it's still buggy, the calls suck, and it freezes alot still, and sometimes you can't see/open snaps until hours after they've been sent. but onto positive stuff, it's a good way to keep in touch with family and friends and also to find and follow snap stars\", \"Great for keeping in touch with my sister, who lives out of state. But it's a data hog. The recent bitmoji update is really bad. Their arms are so long! I had mine dialed in to look exactly like me, and now it looks nothing like me at all! I'm sad about it. I miss the old ones tbh. Also, the AI needs a hide option. I'd very much like to delete it from my conversation page.\", 'The advertisement of Snapchat+ is seriously invasive and annoying. I also find it hilarious that at first you had to pay for \"My AI,\" but now you have to pay to get rid of it. I also wish there was an option to turn off the discover page since I find it so distracting. The one thing I\\'ll never stop complaining about is the new bitmojis. I don\\'t think anyone was asking for creepy 3D ones, and the 2D ones were far more charming. It feels like you\\'re trying to copy Meta (Facebook), disappointing.'], 'appId': 'com.snapchat.android', 'url': 'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.snapchat.android&hl=en&gl=us'}\n"
